## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:ParkfieldCommerce/developer-test.git
cd developer-hiring-test
npm install
gulp
```

Gulp will create a server on `localhost:8080` and will watch for any changes that you make in `/assets/js/app.js`, `index.html` and `/assets/scss/app.scss`

## Instructions

In `assets/img/` you will find two images:

* `Collection_Desktop.png`
* `Mobile_Collection.png`

When looking at designs, ignore building a header and a footer. The focus will be only on the Collection Grid.

### Tasks:
* Build a **responsive grid** following the grid design provided in the `img` folder for Desktop and Mobile.
* Each item in the grid will have color swatches that will produce a black border when active in JavaScript

### Allowed:
* You can use jQuery or Vanilla JavaScript
* You can use any library that you need to complete this task
